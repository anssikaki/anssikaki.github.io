This repository hosts a simple **Delivery Assistant** web app compatible with GitHub Pages. The site is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and communicates with a backend API to generate responses.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser or deploy the repository with GitHub Pages. Choose a **voice** from the dropdown (Friendly, Boring Logistics Expert, or Crazy Person), type your question about your delivery, and press **Send**. The assistant will show a **thinking...** animation while waiting for a response.
