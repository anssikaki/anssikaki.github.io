This repository hosts a simple AI assistant web app compatible with GitHub Pages. The site is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and communicates with a backend API to generate responses.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser or deploy the repository with GitHub Pages. Type your message in the input field and press **Send**. The assistant will show a **thinking...** animation while waiting for a response.
