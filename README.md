# Future Mill Control Panel

This project demonstrates a futuristic control room interface built with p5.js. It now showcases three animated gauges for "Speed", "Power" and "Torque" together with a chat window embedded directly into the panel. The chat is powered by the Azure GPT-4o API described in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Adjust the sliders below the canvas to update the gauges. The chat box appears on the right side of the panel. Optionally attach an image before sending a message to the LLM.
