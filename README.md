# Future Mill Control Panel

This project demonstrates a futuristic control room interface built with p5.js. It features animated gauges for controlling "Speed" and "Power" along with a chat interface powered by the Azure GPT-4o API described in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Adjust the sliders to see the gauges move. Use the chat box to interact with the LLM. Optionally attach an image before sending a message.
