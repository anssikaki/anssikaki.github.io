   - **Boring Logistics Expert** – Provides factual updates in a monotone style.
   - **Crazy Person** – Uses exaggerated, humorous language.

2. **Ask Your Question**
   - Enter a question about your package delivery in the text box.
   - Click **Send** or press **Enter**.

3. **Watch for "thinking..."**

Feel free to modify the voices or prompts in `script.js` if you want different personalities.
